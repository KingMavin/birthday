# Running Marshy's Birthday Card Locally

This guide will help you run this interactive birthday card project on your local machine using VS Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

3. **VS Code**
   - Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Download or Clone the Project

If you're working on Replit and want to run it locally in VS Code:

**Option A: Using Replit SSH**
- In your Replit workspace, open the SSH pane
- Click the "Connect" tab and select "Launch VS Code"
- This will open the project directly in VS Code connected to your Replit environment

**Option B: Download the files**
- Download all project files to your local machine
- Open the project folder in VS Code

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal â†’ New Terminal) and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including:
- React and React DOM
- Vite (development server)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Radix UI components
- Express (backend server)
- And many other dependencies

### 3. Start the Development Server

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- The Express backend server
- The Vite development server for the frontend
- Both running on the same port (typically port 5000)

### 4. View the Application

Once the server starts, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the birthday card welcome page!

### Quick Edit Guide

**To replace a GIF:**
1. Open the file path listed above
2. Go to the line number specified
3. Replace the URL in the `src` attribute with your own image/GIF URL

**To update poems:**
1. Open `client/src/pages/MemoriesPage.tsx`
2. Edit the `poem` text in lines 12, 16, and 20
3. Or edit the birthday poem in `client/src/pages/BirthdayPoemPage.tsx` lines 44-50

### Modify Colors

The pink color scheme is defined in `client/src/index.css`. You can adjust the colors in the `:root` section.

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
- If port 5000 is already in use, you can change it in the `server/index.ts` file

**Dependencies not installing:**
- Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Changes not appearing:**
- The development server has hot reload, but sometimes you may need to refresh your browser
- If that doesn't work, restart the dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev` again)

## Email Notifications Feature

The birthday card includes a subtle notification system that sends you an email based on Marshy's response!

### How It Works

When Marshy reaches the "Would you be mine?" question:

1. **If she clicks "Yes, I would"**: You receive an email with subject "ðŸ’– She said YES!" and message "Yes, you are mine now ðŸ’–"

2. **If she clicks "No, I won't" 15 times**: You receive an email with subject "ðŸ’” Not this time..." and message "Sorry, we can't work ðŸ’”"

### Setting Up Email Notifications

**Default Recipient**: Notifications are configured to send to `amiazreal@gmail.com`

**Current Status**: The notification system is currently **logging to console only**. To enable actual email sending when you host this app elsewhere, you'll need to add an email service provider.

**For Deployment (Hosting Elsewhere)**

When you deploy this app to another hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, your own server, etc.), you'll need to configure an email service. Here are popular options:

**Option 1: Nodemailer with Gmail App Password** (Recommended for Gmail)
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Then in `server/routes.ts`, replace the TODO section with:
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.GMAIL_USER, // Your gmail address
    pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD // App-specific password from Google
  }
});

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: process.env.GMAIL_USER,
  to: emailConfig.to,
  subject: emailConfig.subject,
  text: emailConfig.message
});
```

**Option 2: SendGrid** (Easier for production)
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Option 3: Resend** (Modern, simple API)
```bash
npm install resend
```

**Environment Variables Needed** (when deploying):
- `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: Where to send notifications (default: amiazreal@gmail.com)
- Email service credentials (varies by provider)

**For Testing Locally**: The app will log notification details to the console so you can see when they would be triggered.

### Code Location

- **Backend API**: `server/routes.ts` (line 6-37) - The `/api/notify` endpoint
- **Frontend Logic**: `client/src/pages/QuestionPage.tsx` (line 14-46) - Tracks clicks and sends requests

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with the compiled application ready for deployment.

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues, make sure:
- Node.js version is 18 or higher
- All dependencies installed successfully
- No other applications are using port 5000
- For email notifications: Gmail integration is properly connected on Replit
