Prompt Title: Interactive Romantic Birthday Card for Marshy

Project Description:
Create a cute, romantic, interactive birthday webpage for someone named Marshy. The entire experience should feel soft, loving, and playful, with a pink aesthetic, gentle floating hearts, and smooth page transitions. The page should feature animated gifs, interactive buttons, and poetic text across multiple screens that flow like a story.

Page Structure and Flow
Page 1 – Welcome Page

Background: Soft pink or pastel gradient.

At the top: A cute dancing cat GIF.

Below it: Big friendly text — “Hello Marshy”.

Underneath: Smaller text — “Do you want to see your gift?”

Two buttons:

“Yes please” → proceeds to Page 2.

“No thanks” → leads to a mini “sad cat” scene.

If “No thanks” is chosen:

Show a small sobbing cat GIF.

Text below: “I promise you’ll like it 🥺.”

A single button: “Try again”, which leads back to the question.

When the correct answer is chosen (“Yes please”), the transition to the next page should be a soft fade-in.

Page 2 – Memories Page

Background: Gentle pink with floating hearts.

Display: A few pictures of Marshy (placeholder images) with short, sweet poems beside them.

Add a Next button at the bottom that transitions smoothly to Page 3.

Page 3 – Birthday Poem Page

Background: Same soft aesthetic with heart sparkles.

Center: A heart bear GIF.

Below: A romantic birthday poem (custom text placeholder).

At the bottom: A “Thank you” button.

Page 4 – Reaction Page

Triggered after “Thank you” button.

Show a cute cat GIF on top.

Text: “Did you like it?”

Two options:

“Yes I did”

“No I didn’t”

Fun interaction:
If she clicks “No I didn’t”, the “Yes I did” button gradually gets bigger, while the “No I didn’t” button shrinks and eventually disappears, leaving only “Yes I did.”
Once “Yes I did” is clicked, proceed to the next page.

Page 5 – Sweet Surprise Page

A blushing bear GIF on top.

Text: “Thank you for liking it 💕 But one more thing…”

Button: Next → transitions to final page.

Page 6 – The Question Page

Background: Romantic pink glow or animated floating hearts.

Text: “Would you be mine?”

Two buttons:

“Yes, I do”

“No, I don’t”

Playful interaction:
When hovering or trying to click on “No, I don’t”, it moves around or dodges the cursor playfully.
When she finally clicks “Yes, I do”, display the final scene.

Final Scene – Happy Ending

Background: Soft pink with sparkles or floating hearts.

Kissing bear GIF in the center.

Big text below: “Thank you 💖”

Optionally: Add background music or subtle heart bubble animations.

Design Notes

General theme: Romantic, playful, soft, and interactive.

Animation style: GSAP or CSS animations (smooth transitions, floating hearts, bubble effects).

Gifs can be placeholders for now — I’ll add my own later.

All text should use cute handwriting or script fonts.

Keep all assets lightweight for smooth performance.

Purpose

This project is meant to be a romantic birthday surprise webpage and a cute way to ask Marshy out — something that feels personal, adorable, and emotionally warm.
